Footnotes:
1,"Aggregates are not always equal to the sum of their components."
2,"At the lowest level of detail, it may not be possible to produce a homogeneous series from 1997 to the present. Only industries and certain aggregates that provide good continuity back to 1997 have data from 1997 to 2006."
3,"Effective November 30, 2023, the data is presented on a 2017 reference year basis."
