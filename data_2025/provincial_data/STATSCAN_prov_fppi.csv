Footnotes:
1,"The Farm product price index (FPPI) measures the change through time in prices received by farmers from the sale of agricultural products. The FPPI uses a five-year rolling average base; the annual weighting pattern is updated every year. This method captures the continual shift in agriculture commodities produced and sold. An overall index is available monthly and annually for the provinces and Canada, as are a variety of commodity-group indexes."
2,"This table contains data for years 1935 to present. Not all commodity groups necessarily have data for all years."
3,""0" denotes that either none of the commodities in the commodity group is commercially produced in the province, or marketed in that particular month."
