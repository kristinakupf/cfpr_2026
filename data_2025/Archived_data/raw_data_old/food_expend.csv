2,"For more information about survey methodology, data quality, variable definitions and data products, see the Survey of Household Spending User Guide (catalogue number 62F0026MIE) available free on the Statistics Canada website: <a href="https://www5.statcan.gc.ca/olc-cel/olc.action?ObjId=62F0026M&ObjType=2&lang=en&limit=0">Household expenditures research papers series</a>."
3,"Starting with the 2017 reference year, the Survey of Household Spending (SHS) uses survey weights which take into account population projections from the 2016 Census. Estimates from SHS 2010 to 2016 are based on survey weights which take into account population projections from the 2011 Census."
4,"To ensure data quality, suppression of expenditure estimates is based on the coefficient of variation (CV). Expenditures that have a CV greater than or equal to 35% are suppressed as they are too unreliable to be published."
5,"Starting with the 2017 reference year, the Survey of Household Spending is conducted every two years."
6,"Canada-level statistics include the 10 provinces only."
7,"Does not include day board paid to other private households, which is now included in childcare expenses in household operations."
